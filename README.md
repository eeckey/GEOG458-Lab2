### 1 Harvesting geo-tagged tweets using a API-based crawler
I have created a Twitter crawler to collect geotagged tweets. Below I introduce my comparison of two time periods and why I want to make this comparison.

My geosearch code filters for the key word "Coachella", an annual music and arts festival held at the Empire Polo Club in Indio, California. Across the festival grounds, several stages continuously host live music, as well as the festival being livestreamed on YouTube and other platforms for people across the world to watch. The music festival has a full weekend of performances from April 15-17. The two time periods I will be comparing are Saturday, April 16 and Sunday, April 17 to analyze the geographic distribution of geo-tagged tweets. I collected geotagged tweet data over a period of 30 minutes on each of these days. I want to make this comparison to see the differences between music artists, the location of their fans, popularity of the festival, and number of tweets on the two performance days, and whether one day or performance is more popular for tweets. The maps specifically focus on the United States and the rest of the Americas to get a visual of those that are tweeting at the festival in California and Twitter users watching the livestream and tweeting from other locations. 

### 2 Visualizing geo-tagged data using QGIS
I exported the two maps to the repository and then inserted them in this readme. Below is a comparison of the maps and discussion of why the data represents different geospatial patterns on the maps.

![Map 1](/img/CoachellaMap1.png "Map 1") 
This map shows tweets on 4/16 at around 8:00pm. A large number of tweets were posted in Brazil during this time. These tweets were posted during a performance by Pabllo Vittar, a Brazilian drag queen and singer-songwriter. The high number of tweets from locations in Brazil makes sense because Brazilian fans were posting about the Pabllo Vittar performance. There are a few posts from the Coachella festival location, but a large majority of posts are from Brazil. These users were likely already online in Brazil watching a livestream and could easily post about the performance. 

![Map 2](/img/CoachellaMap2.png "Map 2") 
This map shows tweets on 4/17 at around 7:00pm. An even distriution of amount of tweets were posted in the Unted States and in South America. There is a much wider geographic distribution of tweets on this day compared to the perivious day. There continued to be tweets about the performance by Pabllo Vittar from the day before in Brazil locations, but not as high of a concentration. Secondly, there is a greater amount of tweets overall on this day within the 30 minute collection period. Additionally, more people tweeted while at the Coachella location. Reasons for this higher amount of tweets and greater geographical spread could be the number of performances at this time, the excitement of fans surrounding the performances, or any other news about the festival that Twitter users would want to share their thoughts on with a Twitter post. 

Overall, these two maps show that more people were posting on Twitter during the performances on 4/17. Although both maps have a high number of users posting from locations in Brazil, Map 2 has more users posting from the United States and the festival location. This map information is helpful in order to understand where performer's fans are located and which performances trend the highest on Twitter. 


### 3 Word Cloud Analysis
I exported the two word clouds to the repository and then inserted them in this readme. Below is a comparison of the word clouds and discussion of why they represent different context.

![Word Art 1](/img/WordArt-1.png "Word Art 1") 
The most common words on 4/16 were "Coachella", "Pabllo Vittar", "drag queen", "crying", "happy", and "Flume". Twitter users were very excited and happy about Pabllo Vittar's performance using words like "drag queen" and "#VITTARCHELLA". Fans also enjoyed the performance by 2NE1 using words like "kpop", "girl group", "blackjacks", and "queens". The word cloud also shows other music artists that were perfoming at the time such as Flume, Caroline Polachek, and Jackson Wang. 

![Word Art 2](/img/WordArt-2.png "Word Art 2") 
The most common words on 4/17 were "Coachella", "livestream", "love", "Grupo Firme", and "weekend". Many words centered around Easter such as "Happy Easter" and "Jesus". Additionally, people tweeted about Coachella outfits using words like "trends", "bad", "boring" and "theme". Twitter users continued to tweet about Pabllo Vittar, though not as much compared to during the Saturday performance. One group of words that is different from 4/16 time period is the use of "livestream" and "youtube". There seems to have been an issue with the livestream, causing many more Twitter users across the United States and South America to tweet about their issue. 

Overall, these words clouds share words such as "Coachella", "performance", "performing", and "happy". They put difference emphasis on different music artists based on who is performing on that day. They represent different geographical contexts because fans of the performers are located in many areas of the United States and South America.
